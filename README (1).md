# FlightSafe: Exploratory and Statistical Analysis of Aircraft Performance Data ✈️📊

This project investigates FAA aircraft performance data to identify operational patterns, detect anomalies, and understand how flight parameters such as airspeed, pitch, altitude, and duration interrelate.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze aircraft data to evaluate safety-critical metrics, clean inconsistencies, and apply regression and correlation techniques to discover key relationships in flight performance.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `notebooks/FlightSafe_Analysis_Group9.Rmd`: Initial exploratory and cleaning analysis
- `notebooks/FAA_Advanced_Modeling_Group9.Rmd`: Advanced modeling with regression
- `data/FAA1.csv`, `data/FAA2.xls`: Source datasets
- `assets/banner.png`: Custom project cover image
- `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`

## 🔍 Key Analyses

- Merging FAA datasets from CSV and Excel formats
- Removal of duplicate and abnormal records
- EDA with visualizations using ggplot2
- Correlation and regression modeling (airspeed vs. duration, altitude vs. pitch)
- Interpretation of model fit and statistical significance

## 🛠 Tools Used

- R, RMarkdown
- Libraries: readxl, dplyr, ggplot2, stats
- Excel, CSV formats
